# TempLogger
a small python application that neatly logs my room's ambient temperature throughout the day, plots it on graph and saves it as a PDF file, every day

!important!
before running the program, make sure to create a folder named "2022" or the current year you're running the program in, in which you must create a folder for each month of the year, eg: "01" , "02" , "03" etc...
automatically creating the folders will be added soon I was just lazy

run "templogger.py" and "tempplotter.py" at the same time, and leave them running for as long as possible
if you want to take a look at the temperature graph at any point of the day, run "manualplotter.py" (while the other two are kept running)
