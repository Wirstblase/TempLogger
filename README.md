# TempLogger
a small python application that neatly logs my room's ambient temperature throughout the day, plots it into a graph and saves it as a PDF file, every day

run "templogger.py" and "tempplotter.py" at the same time, and leave them running for as long as possible
if you want to take a look at the temperature graph at any point of the day, run "manualplotter.py" (while the other two are kept running)
